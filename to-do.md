# Issues

# To-Dos
- "setup satellite" is really provision system + satellite config, should break this out
- "Deploy HANA" should really just install HANA - SR and pacemaker should be a separate job
- "Meta" satellite config? perhaps map configurations based on OS - if RHEL8.4 needed for demo, auto-include those components
- IDM?
- Compliance demo
- linux_system_roles --> rhel_system_roles - rebuild EE
