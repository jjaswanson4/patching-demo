# Issues

# To-Dos
- "Deploy HANA" should really just install HANA - SR and pacemaker should be a separate job
- "Meta" satellite config? perhaps map configurations based on OS - if RHEL8.4 needed for demo, auto-include those components
- IDM?
- Compliance demo # in progress
- linux_system_roles --> rhel_system_roles - rebuild EE
- removing controller configuration doesn't need to converge with system teardown in Teardown_* workflows
- code duplication is still high
- manifests should be kept separate
- cloud connector? maybe do an insights demo
